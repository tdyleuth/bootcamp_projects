            <h4 class="title">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h4>
            <img src ="images/BJJ.JPG" alt ="Brazilian Jiu Jitsu" class="bjj">
            <p> I started Brazilian Jiu Jitsu just over a year ago. The majority of my waking hours I'm siting down in the office 
                and I knew I needed something that would put my body to work. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has been one of the most challenging experiences
                but also one of the most rewarding.  I learned that human body can be quite resilient.

            <p> Photography is one of my many hobbies I enjoy. It allows me to capture a moment 
                and present in a unique way. I like to capture memories of different experiences like when I travel to far places or when I get together with 
                friends and family. Photography isn't just for the Instagram likes, I thoroughly enjoy the whole process of taking a photo and editing a photo.
